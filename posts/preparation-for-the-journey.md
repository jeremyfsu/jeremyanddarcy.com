Here's some photos of all the prep work going into the trip. Darcy made activity bins for Madeleine, Nena and Eloise, which the
girls decorated themselves.  We bought a [WaterStep](http://waterstep.org) cup for everyone in the family, so each of us have
a reusable cup for the trip, and someone, somewhere, will have cleaner water.

Packing the RV has been an exercise in efficiency! But I think we have found a place for everything.
